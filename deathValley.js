/* The Park Rangers in Death Valley National Park divide up the feed responsibilities daily for the Bighorn Sheep 
population.

They need a function written for their ranger website, call it feedPerRanger, that takes in

(1) the current population of sheep and (2) the amount of park rangers available during the day, 
and then alerts to the screen the amount of feed each park ranger should be responsible for on that day to the screen. 
This will allow the rangers to load their official Big-Ass Ranger Trucks (BARTs) appropriately.

Each sheep needs 2 lbs of Ranger-provided food per day (in addition to the sparse plantlife it munches). 
Build out the function declaration feedPerRanger to the right. The functionâ€™s output should match the following format:

Each Park Ranger should load <number> lb(s) of feed into his/her BART today.
*/

function feedPerRanger (currentPop, parkRangers) {
	var amount = (currentPop * 2) / parkRangers;
	alert("Each Park Ranger should load " + amount + " lb(s) of feed into his/her BART today.")
}
