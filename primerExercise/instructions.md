# Primer Class HTML&CSS exercise

In this exercise, you will take a template file and modify it to meet a clients specifications.

The client specifications are given in a web design brief, included below, and some wireframes included in the "wireframes.pdf" file.

## Method

The exercise will proceed in iterations. After several iterations, you will complete the changes requested by the client. Your instructor will walk you through the changes necessary for each iteration.

## Resources

Your main resource for this class is *reading the template source code*. This is how you will learn many things on the job. The template contains most, but not all, of the techniques you will need to use.

Here's a [short introduction to HTML.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction)

Here's a [short introduction to CSS.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started)

There's a thousand of these on the web.

A site that has lots of information, carefully hidden among lots of ads and visual noise, is w3schools.com. Here's the [HTML section](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and [CSS section](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp).

# The template

The template file comes from a previous client who just wanted a blog. 

It has some code that you will find useful. It also has some HTML and CSS techniques that you will find useful.

It does not have a navigation panel. You will have to add this. You will also have to add a content div.

It's color palette is primarily shades of gray with some uncontrolled colors and some elements. You'll have to change these colors and get all the elements under control as part of the exercise.



# Web Design Brief

Our client today is a massage therapist. She wants a "brochure" site, a small, static site that highlights her philosophy, presents her business, and invites the visitor to make an appointment by contacting her through the web. 

The site will have a consistent look and feel by repeating the header, navigation panel, and filter elements on all pages.

Note: when we get to site generators and dynamic websites, we will show you how to automatically place headers on every page of the website. However, in this primer class, just create the code when you design the main page and then duplicate the HTML code from page to page. Consider this editing practice.


## Color Palette

The client wants a subtle color palette. She would prefer soothing, tranquil colors. Use [Kuler](https://kuler.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) to find a color palette and modify the CSS file to use the appropriate colors. We suggest a "triad" color scheme with a base color that references the colors in the logo image.

## Body text copy

The client does not have the body text copy ready yet. Show at least two articles on the front page and use the titles as shown in the wireframes. On the *About* page, use the title as shown in the wireframes. However, you should use *lorem ipsum* gibberish as body text. Use one of the generators listed at [this Mashable article](http://mashable.com/2013/07/11/lorem-ipsum/).

## The Container

The contents of the site are contained in a "container" div. The container div should float in the center of the page by using automatic margins in the CSS file. The container div should have the lightest background color of the site.

The background of the page (everything outside the container div) should be either white, black, or the darkest color of the color palette. 

Notice that there are healthy margins around all of the divs inside the container. This provides whitespace among the content that opens up the design, let's it "breathe", and leads to a more engaging customer experience.

## The Header

The header should contain the site title in an h1 container, the site tagline in an an h2 container, and the logo. The logo should float to the right. The header should appear on every page.

## The Navigation Panel

The navigation panel should be on the left-hand side of the page. It should contain three links, one to each of the pages in the site. If possible, the links should highlight with an underlying when the cursor hovers over them. It should also contain the headshot of the client.Use rounded corners and a subtle but distinct background color taken from the color palette to separate it from the main container.

## The Content Panel.

The main content of each page is in the right-hand side of the page. The proportions of the navigation panel to the main content panel should be close to the [golden ratio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio).

## The Form

You can use the form code from the template in the client site. We won't be discussing how forms work in this class. So, it doesn't matter if the form itself works or not. Just make sure it looks the way the client wants.

## The Footer

Put the copyright notice in the footer. Use the "C in a circle" copyright mark.

Make sure that you provide attribution on the photos. You can do this in the footer of the page. Make the text small and use a unobtrusive color. Each attribution should link back to the original location. Note: all of these images are used through a Creative Commons commercial license.
